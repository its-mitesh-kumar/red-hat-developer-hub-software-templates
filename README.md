# pluging-test-6

Welcome to the pluging-test-6 plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Software Template_

## Getting started

Your sample frontend plugin has been created, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/pluging-test-6](http://localhost:3000/pluging-test-6).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
